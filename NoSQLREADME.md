## Description
Created a database of users for a social media website or app.  Using Insomnia I am able to create new users by assigning them a username and email address. A unique _id is created for each user. Using said _id I am able to give them thoughts (posts) and assign any one of them as friends or remove friends. Also able to look up specific users by ID, alter any of their information and thoughts using a PUT request. 

## Installation
MongoDB, Insmonia, node.js
